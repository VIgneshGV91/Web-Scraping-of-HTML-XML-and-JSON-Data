Web Scraping of HTML, XML and JSON Data using Python
This repository contains the coding exercises which I did as part of my Certification on Using Python to access Web Data by by University of Michigan on Coursera. 

I have scraped, parsed, and read web data as well as access data using web APIs. I have worked with HTML, XML, and JSON data formats in Python. The topics include variables and expressions, conditional execution (loops, branching, and try/except), functions, Python data structures (strings, lists, dictionaries, and tuples), and manipulating files.
